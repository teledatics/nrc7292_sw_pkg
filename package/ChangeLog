Change summary for version 1.5:

    New features
    * Multi-STA rate control (RC) for AP (v1.5)
      o Configured by module param, 'ap_rc_mode'
        1: disabled RC
        2: original RC algorithm (AP will use statistics for each STA)
        3: use the same MCS which is used by STA when sending frame
    * RSSI-based rate control (RC) for STA (v1.5)
      o cli_app set rc_pf <1|2> (This should be done before the Wi-Fi connection.)
        1: original RC (default)
        2: RSSI based RC

    Changes
    * Coverage enhancement by using 1/2MHz MCS0 frame on 2/4MHz channels
    * 1/2MHz STA support at 4MHz AP
    * DTS update for SPI interface: enable spidev0.1
    * Enhance auto guard interval (GI) with peer node's GI capability check
    * Add auto RX gain control
    * Increase buffer pool and credit number of AC_BE for flow control between host and target (from 40 to 80 and it's not configurable anymore via the module parameter)
    * WDT reset recovery support on MAP
    * Enhance to discard frames with corrupted host interface header
    * Check traveling pilot support field of S1G capabilities element
    * Enhance to conduct TRX operation during the background scanning

    * Kernel panic triggerd by the inaccessable vif address when hostapd is disabled in 4-address (bridge) mode
    * Fail to enable hybrid security on the relay node
    * Occasional modem recovery operation on the bridged relay node

    Known Issues
    * Not Support 5 US channels due to hostapd channel capacity reason
      (Not supported channel: 100(BW_1M, 925.5MHz), 104(BW_1M, 926.5MHz),
      108(BW_1M, 927.5MHz), 112(BW_2M, 927MHz), 116(BW_4M, 926MHz))
    * Due to the legacy Wi-Fi/HaLow channel mapping, "hostapd_cli chan_switch" command experiences a 60-second delay when using radar channels below:
      5500(#100/925.5MHz), 5520(#104/926.5MHz), 5540(#108/927.5MHz),
      5560(#112/927MHz), 5580(#116/926MHz)
    * DHCP failure or delay in multi-hop MBSS
      (Recommend using static IP in more than 3-hop MBSS)
